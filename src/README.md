# Branch purpose
This branch was created on February 04, 2024 for saving the cluster codes and scripts.

## Files explanation
+ `Simulate_GridMethod.R`
This code was created to simulate using the parameters previously generated by the grid method.

+ `Params-GridMethod.R`
This code was created to generate the parameters for simulation using the grid method.

+ `HeatMap-params.R`
This code was created to generate heat maps displaying the proportion of failed simulations out of all simulations performed with certain parameter combinations.

+ `HeatMap-NAcounts.R`
This code was created to generate heat maps displaying the total number of NAs in the simulations performed with different tolerance combinations (from 1e-01 to 1e-06).

+ `Simulate-Tols.R`
This code was created to simulate using the 36 possible combinations of relative and absolute tolerances (1e-01 to 1e-06).

+ `Symlinks-runs.R`
This code was created to generate symlinks for the simulations with different tolerance combinations.

+ `NaCounting-tols.R`
This code was created to count the number of NAs in the simulations generated using the 36 possible combinations of relative and absolute tolerances (1e-01 to 1e-06).
